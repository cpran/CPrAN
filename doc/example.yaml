Description:
  Short: an example of a plugin descriptor
  Long: >
    This file serves as an example of a CPrAN plugin descriptor.

    This long description is optional, but very useful to have. Line
    breaks in the long description will be converted to spaces, but you
    can start a new paragraph by using a blank line.

    Like so.
