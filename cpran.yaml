Description:
  Short: a package manager for Praat
  Long: >
    CPrAN is a project manager for Praat, inspired by centralised package
    repositories like CPAN, CTAN, CRAN and the like, but also in more recent
    solutions like yum and bower.

    This plugin contains a Perl client to interact with a remote instance of
    CPrAN, as well as wrapper scripts for Praat to allow interaction from
    within the GUI.
