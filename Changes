0.04      2017-02-16 00:52:43+00:00 Europe/London

  * New:
    * deps, show, and test read a plugin from the working directory
      when no arguments are passed
    * Read some global options from environment variables:
      * Praat preferences directory: CPRAN_PREF_DIR
      * CPrAN root:                  CPRAN_ROOT_DIR
      * Path to Praat binary:        CPRAN_PRAAT_BIN
      * GitLab API token:            CPRAN_API_TOKEN  
    * install now accepts requested versions of both plugins and
      Praat. They are provided by separating the name and the
      version with a colon: `cpran install utils:0.0.15`
    * install takes new --barren option to install "barren" version
      of Praat, suitable for running in headless servers
    * init takes new --reinstall option for forcing re-initialisation
  * Changes:
    * Commands that take arguments from STDIN now read STDIN 
      only when their only argument is a hyphen ("-"): deps, 
      test, show, install, remove, update, and upgrade.
    * Fetching of Praat releases and packages done through Github
      API, which is more stable than that of the Praat website
    * Install sets up a "cpran" remote qhen using git, so as to not 
      interfere with user remotes
    * Partial list of Praat releases is now delivered in decreasing 
      order
  * Fixes:
    * Major refactor: client now uses Moose
    * New method for detecting Praat versions by directly parsing
      binary. More robust for versions before and after 6.0.0, but
      untested in Mac.
    * Better support for specified paths for plugins
    * Multiple minor bug fixes and improvements throughout
